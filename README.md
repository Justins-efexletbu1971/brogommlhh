Just wow man just walked out of The Monkey, head spinning like, what was even that? Popcorn everywhere, still feel it in my teeth, and my back is killing me from those seats — they’re practically medieval torture devices. The theater was so noisy, people crunching, whispering, but then it got like pin-drop quiet during that scene where the monkey just stared into the camera. Right into my soul, y’know? 

> The start was slow, like molasses dripping off a spoon, but then it hit like a freight train outta nowhere. There was this moment with the bananas — like, who knew bananas could be menacing? And then whoops, forgot to send the voice note, anyway, someone was asking if they should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   but I think it needs to be 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 live, that tropical storm of feelings only makes sense in the dark cocoon of a theater.

There was that bizarre scene mid-way, flowers everywhere, you suddenly feel like in a Monet painting but then boom — blood! And the monkey's scream echoing, got in my head real bad, like trying to get a song out that’s stuck, except instead it’s this unnerving shriek. Was that meant to symbolize something? No idea. Maybe I’m not artsy enough, I dunno. 

Felt like I was inside a dream that couldn’t decide if it was a nightmare or not. And the lighting, oh the lights were like being inside a frickin’ aquarium, blues, greens, suddenly a punch of red — blinding. The theatre was a zoo by the end of it, people leaving in near silence as if they'd just witnessed an eclipse or their ex at grocery store — awkward but fascinating. 

𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  ?? Sure, if you wanna experience that throbbing cerebral mess full of whispers and roars. Not at all what I expected from a 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 titled The Monkey. The only thing I know for sure is I’ll be thinking about this for days. Maybe forever?
